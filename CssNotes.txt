   It is an algorithm used by browsers to determine CSS declaration which is more relevant to an element
   It calculates weight of a html element to determine which rule to apply. 

   specific weight - (ID,Class,TagName)

   *Id > Class > TagName
   * is() has() not() pseudo classes doesn't add value while calculating specific weight but the values
   passed inside them, its specifc weight is added
   example - is(.myClass) - (0,1,0)
   *Inline CSS has the highest Specficity
   *If Specficity clashes , lastest css is given more preference
   * !important -  It reverses the specificity of the element
