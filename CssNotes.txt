1. CSS Specificity - 
   It is an algorithm used by browsers to determine CSS declaration which is more relevant to an element
   It calculates weight of a html element to determine which rule to apply. 

   specific weight - (ID,Class,TagName)

   *Id > Class > TagName
   * is() has() not() pseudo classes doesn't add value while calculating specific weight but the values
   passed inside them, its specifc weight is added
   example - is(.myClass) - (0,1,0)
   *Inline CSS has the highest Specficity
   *If Specficity clashes , lastest css is given more preference
   * !important -  It reverses the specificity of the element

2. Box Model ->
   It defines how elements are structured and positioned in a web page
   It consists of four main components ->
   content
   border
   margin
   padding

   box-sizing ->  default content-box -> means height and width applies only to content area. 
                  border box -> means box height & width contains margin and padding

3. z-index - 
   It is related to its parent's z-index
   used to displace elements on the z-axis i.e in or out of the screen.
   It is used to define the order of elements if they overlap with each other.

4. Position - 

   Fixed -> relative tot he view port
   Static -> default
   relative -> we can set top bottom right left properties
   absolute -> positioned relative to its first positioned parent 


5. Block vs inline ->
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right
    as far as it can
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
   
6. Flex box -> 
   It provides a layout Model for clean and easy arrangements of elements within a container
   It provides 1-D layout

7. Grid ->
   It offers row column based layouts and has 2-dimensional layout
