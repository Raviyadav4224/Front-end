1. Script Tag - 

    <Script defer src='index.js'/>
    properties

    defer - It is downloaded in the background and loads the Javacsript after HTML parsing is complete
    
    async - It is downloaded in the background and  executes as soon as it is available 

    *Scripts placed inside body tag executes after HTML content is loaded
    
2. HTML 5 features -
    Audio video tag
    Header Footer tag
    Nav tag

3. Elements vs tags -
    Tags -> <span>, div tag executes
    Elements -> It holds the content of the tag

4. Comments -> 
    <!-- This is a comment -->

5. Defer,Async attributes in script tag -

    <script defer src="index.js"></script>
        * Loads the script Asynchronously (with HTML parsing)
        * Execution is deferred until HTML is fully parsed
        * Ensures scripts are executed in given order

    <script async src="index.js"></script>
        * Loads the script Asynchronously (with HTML parsing)
        * Execution starts as soon as the script is downlaoded, it doesn't waits for HTML parsing
        * Execution order of scripts are not guaranteed

6. window.onload vs DOMContentLoaded event -

    onload -
        * Executes only after entire page and resources are loaded

    DOMContentLoaded -
        * Executes as soon as the HTML is fully parsed and DOM is built
          It doesn't waits for external resources.

        *  example 
                <script src="async.js" async></script>
                <script src="defer.js" defer></script>

                <script>
                document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
                    console.log("DOM fully loaded!");
                });

                window.onload = () => {
                    console.log("All resources loaded!");
                };
                </script>

               **   async.js (may execute at any time after loading).
                    DOM parsing completes.
                    defer.js executes (in order before DOMContentLoaded).
                    DOMContentLoaded event fires.
                    window.onload event fires.
