1. Script Tag - 

    <Script defer src='index.js'/>
    properties

    defer - It is downloaded in the background and loads the Javacsript after HTML parsing is complete
    
    async - It is downloaded in the background and  executes as soon as it is available 

    *Scripts placed inside body tag executes after HTML content is loaded
    
2. HTML 5 features -
    Audio video tag
    Header Footer tag
    Nav tag

3. Elements vs tags -
    Tags -> <span>, div tag executes
    Elements -> It holds the content of the tag

4. Comments -> 
    <!-- This is a comment -->

5. Defer,Async attributes in script tag -

    <script defer src="index.js"></script>
        * Loads the script Asynchronously (with HTML parsing)
        * Execution is deferred until HTML is fully parsed
        * Ensures scripts are executed in given order

    <script async src="index.js"></script>
        * Loads the script Asynchronously (with HTML parsing)
        * Execution starts as soon as the script is downlaoded, it doesn't waits for HTML parsing
        * Execution order of scripts are not guaranteed

6. window.onload vs DOMContentLoaded event -

    onload -
        * Executes only after entire page and resources are loaded

    DOMContentLoaded -
        * Executes as soon as the HTML is fully parsed and DOM is built
          It doesn't waits for external resources.

        *  example 
                <script src="async.js" async></script>
                <script src="defer.js" defer></script>

                <script>
                document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
                    console.log("DOM fully loaded!");
                });

                window.onload = () => {
                    console.log("All resources loaded!");
                };
                </script>

               **   async.js (may execute at any time after loading).
                    DOM parsing completes.
                    defer.js executes (in order before DOMContentLoaded).
                    DOMContentLoaded event fires.
                    window.onload event fires. 
7. Position Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed & Sticky
    * Relative - 
        This proeprty allows for adding top left bottom etc porperty to the given element
        The element does not comes out of normal flow, it remains at its original position
        
    * Absolute -
        The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, if none of the ancestors are
        positioned relative / absolute / fixed it looks for parents position (HTML)
        Element comes out of the normal flow and does not remains at its normal position

    * Fixed -
        The element is fixed wrt VIEWPORT
        Element comes out of the normal flow
        It remains fixed even if the Container containing it ends
        It the element is position fixed and outside the VIEWPORT it will never shown on screen 
        since it is positioned wrt VIEWPORT
        
    * Sticky -
        It is an hybrid of Relative and Fixed
        It will acts as relative initially and when it reaches the threshold values of top,bottom etc it 
        becomes Fixed
        It is fixed within the container containing it and does not moves outside
        When it leaves its container, it sticks to the threshold position

8. Importing FONTS in HTML/React -
    
    1. Using Link tag -

        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
        <link
            href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito:ital,wght@0,200..1000;1,200..1000&family=Yuji+Mai&display=swap"
            rel="stylesheet"/>

    2. Using @import -

        Import the CSS in style.css file
        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito:ital,wght@0,200..1000;1,200..1000&family=Yuji+Mai&display=swap');

    3. Using @font-face rule -
        It is used for using Local fonts and Custom fonts

        @font-face{
            font-family: "MyFonts";
            src:url('MagazineLetter.ttf') format("truetype");
        }
        * {
            margin: 0%;
            padding: 0;
